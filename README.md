The ICGC Python REST Client
============================

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/icgc-python/badge/?version=develop)](http://icgc-python.readthedocs.io/en/develop/?badge=develop)

The ICGC REST client is a simple python module that allows you to access the **International Consortium for Cancer and Genomics** web portal directly through Python, with a minimum of coding effort.

It lets you write queries in our Portal Query Language ( `PQL <https://github.com/icgc-dcc/dcc-portal/blob/develop/dcc-portal-pql/PQL.md>`_ ) that fetch data from the ICGC web portal as JSON objects. From there, you can use the power of Python to process and analyze the data within those objects however you see fit.
